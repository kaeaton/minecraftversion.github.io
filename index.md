## How to set your Minecraft client to the same version as the server

Pebble is supposed to auto-update the version of our server, but hasn't yet. So to access our server, you need to run the last version of Minecraft (in this case 1.16.2)

Start by going to installations.

Make sure only versions are checked, then select New.

Name your new installation something easy to identify, then select the version dropdown.

In this case we want 1.16.2.

You can leave the other settings at their defaults. Click create.
